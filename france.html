                    <p>France is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories 
                        include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, 
                        and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive 
                        economic zones in the world. </p>
            
                    <p>Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the 
                        area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom 
                        of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. In the 16th century, French culture flourished 
                        during the French Renaissance and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict 
                        with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in 
                        the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

                        <p>The Storming of the Bastille which occurred in Paris, France, on 14 July 1789, 
                            was an act of political violence by revolutionary insurgents who attempted to storm 
                            and seize control of the medieval armoury, fortress, and political prison known as the Bastille. 
                            After four hours of fighting and 94 deaths, the insurgents were able to enter the Bastille. 
                            The governor of the Bastille, Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay, and several members of the garrison 
                            were killed after surrendering. At the time, the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. 
                            The prison contained only seven inmates at the time of its storming and was already scheduled for 
                            demolition but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy's abuse of power. 
                            Its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution.</p>

                    <h2>The Coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte (December 2, 1804)</h2>
                    <p>Napoleon I and his wife Joséphine were crowned Emperor and Empress of the French on Sunday, 
                        December 2, 1804 (11 Frimaire, Year XIII according to the French Republican calendar, 
                        commonly used at the time in France), at Notre-Dame de Paris in Paris. It marked "the instantiation of 
                        the modern empire" and was a "transparently masterminded piece of modern propaganda". On May 18, 1804, 
                        the Sénat conservateur vested the Republican government of the French First Republic in an emperor, 
                        and preparations for the coronation followed. Napoleon's elevation to emperor was overwhelmingly approved 
                        by the French people in the French constitutional referendum of 1804. Among Napoleon's motivations for being 
                        crowned were to gain prestige in international royalist and Roman Catholic circles and to lay the foundation 
                        for a future dynasty.</p>

                        <p>The liberation of Paris was a battle that took place during World War II from 19 August 1944 
                            until the German garrison surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944. Paris had been 
                            occupied by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940, after which the 
                            Wehrmacht occupied northern and western France. The liberation began when the French Forces of the 
                            Interior—the military structure of the French Resistance—staged an uprising against the German garrison 
                            upon the approach of the US Third Army, led by General George S. Patton. On the night of 24 August, 
                            elements of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque's 2nd French Armored Division made their way into 
                            Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville shortly before midnight.</p>

                        <h2>The Eiffel Tower</h2>
                        <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. 
                            It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. 
                            Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centrepiece of the 1889 
                            World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised 
                            by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural 
                            icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.</p>

                            is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France, standing at the western 
                            end of the Champs-Élysées at the centre of Place Charles de Gaulle, formerly 
                            named Place de l'Étoile—the étoile or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve 
                            radiating avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 
                            16th (south and west), 17th (north), and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who 
                            fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all 
                            French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the 
                            Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I. </p>

                        <h2>The Louvre Museum</h2>
                        <p>The Louvre or the Louvre Museum , is a national art museum in Paris, France, 
                            and one of the most famous museums in the world. It is located on the Right Bank of 
                            the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward) and home to some of the most 
                            canonical works of Western art, including the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. 
                            The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century 
                            under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. 
                            Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis 
                            I converted it into the primary residence of the French kings.</p>
