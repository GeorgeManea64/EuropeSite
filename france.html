            <p>France is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories 
                include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, 
                and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive 
                economic zones in the world. </p>
    
            <p>Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the 
                area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom 
                of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. In the 16th century, French culture flourished 
                during the French Renaissance and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict 
                with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in 
                the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

                <h2>The Storming of the Bastille (July 14, 1789)</h2>
                <p>The Storming of the Bastille which occurred in Paris, France, on 14 July 1789, 
                    was an act of political violence by revolutionary insurgents who attempted to storm 
                    and seize control of the medieval armoury, fortress, and political prison known as the Bastille. 
                    After four hours of fighting and 94 deaths, the insurgents were able to enter the Bastille. 
                    The governor of the Bastille, Bernard-Ren√© Jourdan de Launay, and several members of the garrison 
                    were killed after surrendering. At the time, the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. 
                    The prison contained only seven inmates at the time of its storming and was already scheduled for 
                    demolition but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy's abuse of power. 
                    Its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution. </p>
