                        <p>Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a country in Southern and Western Europe. It consists 
                            of a peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Alps on its northern land border, 
                            as well as nearly 800 islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia. Italy shares land borders with France 
                            to the west; Switzerland and Austria to the north; Slovenia to the east; and the two enclaves of 
                            Vatican City and San Marino. It is the tenth-largest country in Europe by area, covering 301,340 km2 
                            (116,350 sq mi), and the third-most populous member state of the European Union, with nearly 59 
                            million inhabitants. Italy's capital and largest city is Rome; other major cities include Milan, 
                            Naples, Turin, Palermo, Bologna, Florence, Genoa, and Venice.</p>

                        <p>A developed country with an advanced economy, Italy has the eighth-largest nominal GDP in the world, 
                            the second-largest manufacturing sector in Europe, and plays a significant role in regional and—to a 
                            lesser extent—global economic, military, cultural, and political affairs. Italy is a founding and leading 
                            member of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and is part of numerous other international 
                            organizations and forums. As a cultural superpower, Italy has long been a renowned global centre of art, 
                            music, literature, cuisine, fashion, science and technology, and the source of multiple inventions and 
                            discoveries. It has the highest number of World Heritage Sites (60) and is the fourth-most visited country 
                            in the world.</p>

                            <h2>The Roman Empire (27 BCE)</h2>
                            <p>The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. 
                                The Romans conquered most of this during the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following 
                                Octavian's assumption of effective sole rule in 27 BC. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, 
                                but the eastern empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.</p>

                            <p>By 100 BC, the city of Rome had expanded its rule from the Italian peninsula to most of 
                                the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and 
                                political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony 
                                and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the 
                                Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power 
                                (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. 
                                The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls 
                                who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but 
                                were governed by legates.</p>

                        <h2>The Italian Renaissance (14th–15th centuries)</h2>
                        <p>The Italian Renaissance was a period in Italian history between the 14th and 16th centuries. 
                            The period is known for the initial development of the broader Renaissance culture that spread 
                            across Western Europe and marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. Proponents of a 
                            "long Renaissance" argue that it started around the year 1300 and lasted until about 1600. 
                            In some fields, a Proto-Renaissance, beginning around 1250, is typically accepted. 
                            The French word renaissance (corresponding to rinascimento in Italian) means 'rebirth', 
                            and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in classical antiquity 
                            after the centuries during what Renaissance humanists labelled as the "Dark Ages". 
                            The Italian Renaissance historian Giorgio Vasari used the term rinascita ('rebirth') in his 
                            Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects in 1550, but the concept became 
                            widespread only in the 19th century, after the work of scholars such as Jules Michelet and 
                            Jacob Burckhardt.</p>

                            <h2>Unification of Italy (1861)</h2>
                            <p>The unification of Italy, also known as the Risorgimento, was the 19th century political 
                                and social movement that in 1861 ended in the annexation of various states of the Italian 
                                peninsula and its outlying isles to the Kingdom of Sardinia, resulting in the creation of 
                                the Kingdom of Italy. Inspired by the rebellions in the 1820s and 1830s against the outcome 
                                of the Congress of Vienna, the unification process was precipitated by the Revolutions of 1848, 
                                and reached completion in 1870 after the capture of Rome and its designation as the capital of 
                                the Kingdom of Italy.</p>

                            <p>Individuals who played a major part in the struggle for unification and liberation 
                                from foreign domination included King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy; politician, 
                                economist and statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour; general Giuseppe Garibaldi; 
                                and journalist and politician Giuseppe Mazzini.Borrowing from the old Latin title Pater 
                                Patriae of the Roman emperors, the Italians gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet 
                                of Father of the Fatherland (Italian: Padre della Patria).Even after 1870, many ethnic 
                                Italian-speakers (Italians in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Savoyard Italians, Corfiot 
                                Italians, Niçard Italians, Swiss Italians, Corsican Italians, Maltese Italians, Istrian 
                                Italians, and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy, 
                                planting the seeds of Italian irredentism.</p>

                            <p>The Colosseum, ultimately from Ancient Greek word "kolossos" meaning a large statue or giant 
                                is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. 
                                It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre 
                                in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 
                                and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). 
                                Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).The three emperors 
                                who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the 
                                Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association 
                                with their family name (Flavius).</p>

                            <p>The Grand Canal, locally and informally Canalazzo, is the largest channel in Venice,

                                end leads into the basin at San Marco; in between, it makes a large reverse-S shape 
                                through the central districts (sestieri) of Venice. It is 3.8 kilometres (2.4 miles) 
                                long, and 30 to 90 metres (98 to 295 ft) wide, with an average depth of 5 metres (16 feet).</p>
