                        <p>The Czech Republic, also known as Czechia and historically known as Bohemia, is a landlocked 
                            country in Central Europe. The country is bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, 
                            Poland to the northeast, and Slovakia to the southeast. The Czech Republic has a hilly landscape 
                            that covers an area of 78,871 square kilometers (30,452 sq mi) with a mostly temperate continental 
                            and oceanic climate. The capital and largest city is Prague; other major cities and urban areas 
                            include Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Liberec.</p>

                        <p>The Duchy of Bohemia was founded in the late 9th century under Great Moravia. 
                            It was formally recognized as an Imperial Estate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1002 and became a 
                            kingdom in 1198.[16][17] Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, all of the Lands of the Bohemian 
                            Crown were gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. Nearly a hundred years later, the 
                            Protestant Bohemian Revolt led to the Thirty Years' War. After the Battle of White Mountain, the 
                            Habsburgs consolidated their rule. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Crown 
                            lands became part of the Austrian Empire.</p>

                            <h2>Defenestrations of Prague (1419, 1483, 1618)</h2>
                            <p>The Defenestrations of Prague were three incidents in the history of Bohemia in which people 
                                were defenestrated (thrown out of a window). Though already existing in Middle French, the word 
                                defenestrate is believed to have first been used in English in reference to the episodes in 
                                Prague in 1618 when the disgruntled Protestant estates threw two royal governors and their 
                                secretary out of a window of the Hradčany Castle and wrote an extensive apologia explaining 
                                their action. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, defenestration was not uncommon—the 
                                act carried elements of lynching and mob violence in the form of murder committed together.</p>

                            <p>The first governmental defenestration occurred in 1419, the second in 1483 and the third in 1618, 
                                although the term "Defenestration of Prague" more commonly refers to the third. Often, however, 
                                the 1483 event is not recognized as a "significant defenestration", which leads to some ambiguity 
                                when the 1618 defenestration is referred to as the "second Prague defenestration". The first and 
                                third defenestrations helped to trigger a prolonged religious conflict, either inside Bohemia 
                                (the Hussite Wars, 1st defenestration) or beyond (Thirty Years' War, 3rd defenestration), while 
                                the second helped establish a religious peace in the country for 31 years (Peace of Kutná Hora, 
                                2nd defenestration).</p>

                        <h2>The Foundation of Czechoslovakia (1918)</h2>
                        <p>The area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it collapsed at the end of World War I. 
                            The new state was founded by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, who served as its first president from 
                            14 November 1918 to 14 December 1935. He was succeeded by his close ally Edvard Beneš (1884–1948). </p>

                        <p>The roots of Czech nationalism go back to the 19th century, when philologists and educators, 
                            influenced by Romanticism, promoted the Czech language and pride in the Czech people. Nationalism 
                            became a mass movement in the second half of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the limited 
                            opportunities for participation in political life under Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as 
                            historian František Palacký (1798–1876) founded various patriotic self-help organizations which 
                            provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life before independence. 
                            Palacký supported Austro-Slavism and worked for a reorganized federal Austrian Empire, which would 
                            protect the Slavic speaking peoples of Central Europe against Russian and German threats.</p>

                            <h2>Velvet Revolution (1989)</h2>
                            <p>The Velvet Revolution or Gentle Revolution was a non-violent transition of power in what 
                                was then Czechoslovakia, occurring from 17 November to 28 November 1989. Popular demonstrations 
                                against the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia included students and 
                                older dissidents. The result was the end of 41 years of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and 
                                the subsequent dismantling of the command economy and conversion to a parliamentary republic.</p>

                            <p>On 17 November 1989 (International Students' Day), riot police suppressed a student demonstration 
                                in Prague. The event marked the 50th anniversary of a violently suppressed demonstration against 
                                the Nazi storming of Prague University in 1939 where 1,200 students were arrested and 9 killed 
                                (see Origin of International Students' Day). The 1989 event sparked a series of demonstrations 
                                from 17 November to late December and turned into an anti-communist demonstration. On 20 November, 
                                the number of protesters assembled in Prague grew from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated 
                                500,000. The entire top leadership of the Communist Party, including General Secretary Miloš Jakeš, 
                                resigned on 24 November. On 27 November, a two-hour general strike involving all citizens of 
                                Czechoslovakia was held.</p>

                            <p>Prague Castle is a castle complex in Prague, Czech Republic serving as the official residence 
                                and workplace of the president of the Czech Republic. Built in the 9th century, the castle has 
                                long served as the seat of power for kings of Bohemia, Holy Roman emperors, and presidents of 
                                Czechoslovakia. As such, the term "Prague Castle" or simply the "Castle" or "the Hrad" are often 
                                used as metonymy for the president and his staff and advisors. The Bohemian Crown Jewels are kept 
                                within a hidden room inside it.</p>

                            <p>According to the Guinness Book of Records, Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle in the world, 
                                occupying an area of almost 70,000 square metres (750,000 square feet), at about 570 metres 
                                (1,870 feet) in length and an average of about 130 metres (430 feet) wide. The castle is among 
                                the most visited tourist attractions in Prague, attracting over 1.8 million visitors annually.</p>

                            <p>The site includes the main concentration camp at Auschwitz I and the remains of the concentration 
                                and extermination camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Both were developed and run by Nazi Germany 
                                during its occupation of Poland in 1939–1945. The Polish government has preserved the site as 
                                a research centre and in memory of the 1.1 million people who died there, including 960,000 Jews, 
                                during World War II and the Holocaust. It became a World Heritage Site in 1979. Piotr Cywiński

                            <p>Warsaw Old Town, also known as Old Town, and historically known as Old Warsaw, 
                                is a neighbourhood, and an area of the City Information System, in the city of Warsaw, 
                                Poland, located within the district of Śródmieście. It is the oldest portion of the city, 
                                and contains numerous historic buildings, mostly from 17th and 18th centuries, such as the 
                                Royal Castle, city walls, St. John's Cathedral, and the Barbican, the Old Town Market Square 
                                and the Warsaw Mermaid Statue. The settlement itself dates back to between the 13th and 
                                14th centuries, and was granted town privileges c. 1300.</p>

                            <p>During World War II, the Old Town was nearly totally destroyed, and subsequently reconstructed. 
                                The project was the world's first attempt to resurrect an entire historic city core and was 
                                included on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1980. The reconstruction efforts were again 
                                recognized in 2011 when all its documents and records were added by UNESCO to its Memory of 
                                the World international register.</p>
