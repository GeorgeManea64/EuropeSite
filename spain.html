                        <p>Spain, or the Kingdom of Spain, is a country in Southern and Western Europe with territories 
                            in North Africa. Featuring the southernmost point of continental Europe, it is the largest 
                            country in Southern Europe and the fourth-most populous European Union member state. Spanning 
                            across the majority of the Iberian Peninsula, its territory also includes the Canary Islands, 
                            in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands, in the Western Mediterranean Sea, and the 
                            autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, in mainland Africa. Peninsular Spain is bordered to the 
                            north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea 
                            and Gibraltar; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Spain's capital and largest city 
                            is Madrid, and other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia, 
                            and Palma de Mallorca.</p>

                        <p>In early antiquity, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by Celts, Iberians, and other pre-Roman peoples. 
                            With the Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula, the province of Hispania was established. Following 
                            the Romanisation and Christianisation of Hispania, the fall of the Western Roman Empire ushered in the 
                            inward migration of tribes from Central Europe, including the Visigoths, who formed the Visigothic Kingdom 
                            centred on Toledo. In the early eighth century, most of the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad 
                            Caliphate, and during early Islamic rule, Al-Andalus became a dominant peninsular power centred on Córdoba. 
                            The several Christian kingdoms that emerged in Northern Iberia, chief among them Asturias, León, 
                            Castile, Aragon and Navarre, made an intermittent southward military expansion and repopulation, 
                            known as the Reconquista, repelling Islamic rule in Iberia, which culminated with the Christian seizure 
                            of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492. The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of 
                            Aragon in 1479 under the Catholic Monarchs is often considered the de facto unification of Spain as a 
                            nation state.</p>

                            <h2>Reconquista (1492)</h2>
                            <p>The Reconquistaor the fall of al-Andaluswas a series of military and cultural campaigns 
                                that European Christian kingdoms waged against the Muslim kingdoms following the Muslim 
                                conquest of the Iberian Peninsula by the Umayyad Caliphate, culminating in the reign of 
                                the Catholic Monarchs of Spain. The beginning of the Reconquista is traditionally dated 
                                to the Battle of Covadonga (c. 718 or 722), in which an Asturian army achieved the first 
                                Christian victory over the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate since the beginning of the military invasion. The Reconquista ended in 1492 with the fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs.</p>

                            <p>In the late 10th century, the Umayyad vizier Almanzor waged a series of military campaigns 
                                for 30 years in order to subjugate the northern Christian kingdoms. When the Caliphate of 
                                Córdoba disintegrated in the early 11th century, a series of petty successor states known as 
                                taifas emerged. The northern kingdoms took advantage of this situation and struck deep into 
                                al-Andalus; they fostered civil war, intimidated the weakened taifas, and made them pay large 
                                tributes (parias) for "protection".</p>

                        <h2>Voyages of Christopher Columbus (1492 - 1504)</h2>
                        <p>Between 1492 and 1504, the Italian explorer and navigator Christopher Columbus led four 
                            transatlantic maritime expeditions in the name of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain to the 
                            Caribbean and to Central and South America. These voyages led to the widespread knowledge 
                            of the New World. This breakthrough inaugurated the period known as the Age of Exploration, 
                            which saw the colonization of the Americas, a related biological exchange, and trans-Atlantic 
                            trade. These events, the effects and consequences of which persist to the present, are often 
                            cited as the beginning of the modern era.</p>

                        <p>Born in the Republic of Genoa, Columbus was a navigator who sailed in search of a westward 
                            route to India, China, Japan and the Spice Islands thought to be the East Asian source of 
                            spices and other precious oriental goods obtainable only through arduous overland routes. 
                            Columbus was partly inspired by 13th-century Italian explorer Marco Polo in his ambition 
                            to explore Asia. His initial belief that he had reached "the Indies" has resulted in the 
                            name "West Indies" being attached to the Bahamas and the other islands of the Caribbean.</p>

                            <h2>The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)</h2>
                            <p>The Spanish Civil War was fought from 1936 to 1939 between the Republicans and the Nationalists. 
                                Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic. 
                                The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of Falangists, monarchists, conservatives, and 
                                traditionalists led by a military junta among whom General Francisco Franco quickly achieved 
                                a preponderant role. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war was variously 
                                viewed as class struggle, a religious struggle, or a struggle between dictatorship and republican 
                                democracy, between revolution and counterrevolution, or between fascism and communism. 
                                The Nationalists won the war, which ended in early 1939, and ruled Spain until Franco's 
                                death in November 1975.</p>

                            <p>The war began after the partial failure of the coup d'état of July 1936 against the Popular Front 
                                government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, with General Emilio 
                                Mola as the primary planner and leader and General José Sanjurjo as a figurehead. 
                                The Nationalist faction was supported by several conservative groups, including CEDA, monarchists, 
                                including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists, and the Falange 
                                Española de las JONS, a fascist political party. The uprising was supported by military units in 
                                Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Cádiz, Córdoba, Málaga, and Seville. However, 
                                rebelling units in almost all important cities did not gain control. Those cities remained in the 
                                hands of the government, leaving Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalist forces 
                                received munitions, soldiers, and air support from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany while the 
                                Republican side received support from the Soviet Union and Mexico. Other countries, such as the 
                                United Kingdom, France, and the United States, continued to recognise the Republican government 
                                but followed an official policy of non-intervention. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of 
                                citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict, mostly in the 
                                pro-Republican International Brigades.</p>

                            <p>The Colosseum, ultimately from Ancient Greek word "kolossos" meaning a large statue or giant 
                                is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. 
                                It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre 
                                in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 
                                and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). 
                                Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).The three emperors 
                                who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the 
                                Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association 
                                with their family name (Flavius).</p>

                                through the central districts (sestieri) of Venice. It is 3.8 kilometres (2.4 miles)
