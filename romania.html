                        <p>Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe. 
                            It borders Ukraine to the north and east, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, 
                            Bulgaria to the south, Moldova to the east, and the Black Sea to the southeast. It has a mainly 
                            continental climate, and an area of 238,397 km2 (92,046 sq mi) with a population of 19 million people. 
                            Romania is the twelfth-largest country in Europe and the sixth-most populous member state of the 
                            European Union. Europe's second-longest river, the Danube, empties into the Danube Delta in the southeast 
                            of the country. The Carpathian Mountains cross Romania from the north to the southwest and include 
                            Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of 2,544 m (8,346 ft). Bucharest is the country's largest urban area 
                            and financial centre. Other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Constanța and Brașov.</p>

                        <p>Settlement in the territory of modern Romania began in the Lower Paleolithic, later becoming the 
                            Dacian Kingdom before Roman conquest and Romanisation. The modern Romanian state formed in 1859 with the 
                            unification of Moldavia and Wallachia under Alexandru Ioan Cuza, becoming Kingdom of Romania in 1881 
                            under Carol I. Romania gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877, formalised by the Treaty 
                            of Berlin. After World War I, Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina, and Bessarabia joined the Old Kingdom, 
                            forming Greater Romania, which reached its largest territorial extent. In 1940, under Axis pressure, 
                            Romania lost territories to Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union. Following the 1944 Romanian coup 
                            d'état, Romania switched sides to join the Allies. After World War II, it regained Northern Transylvania 
                            through the Paris Peace Treaties. Under Soviet occupation, King Michael I was forced to abdicate, and 
                            Romania became a socialist republic and Warsaw Pact member. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a 
                            transition to liberal democracy and a market economy.</p>

                            <h2>Unification of Moldova and Wallachia (1859)</h2>
                            <p>The unification of Moldavia and Wallachia also known as the unification of the Romanian Principalities 
                                or as the Little Union (Romanian: Mica Unire), happened in 1859 following the election of 
                                Alexandru Ioan Cuza as prince of both the Principality of Moldavia and the Principality of Wallachia. 
                                A potential unification between the two principalities, which shared a common Romanian ethnicity, 
                                language, and culture, had not been favored by the great powers for a long time, although it was 
                                accepted by them once it happened. The unification of these two states began a political struggle 
                                in the new country (the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia) to find out which of the 
                                two regions would obtain "supremacy" and met some opposition in Moldavia by the so-called "separatists".</p>

                            <p>Nowadays, in Romania, the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia is regarded as a prelude to the 
                                Great Union, a name used in Romanian historiography to refer to the unifications of Romania with 
                                the regions of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania in 1918 during or following the end of 
                                World War I It is also commemorated every 24 January through the Day of the Unification of the 
                                Romanian Principalities in both Romania and Moldova.</p>

                        <h2>Great Union (1918)</h2>
                        <p>In Romanian historiography, the Great Union or Great Union of 1918 (Marea Unire din 1918) 
                            was the series of political unifications the Kingdom of Romania had with several of the Romanian 
                            historical regions, starting with Bessarabia on 27 March 1918, continuing with Bukovina on 
                            28 November 1918 and finalizing with Transylvania (on its broad meaning) on 1 December 1918 
                            with the declaration of the union of this region with Romania during an assembly at the city of 
                            Alba Iulia. Romanians also consider several other events as preludes to the Great Union, such as 
                            the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia (also known as the Little Union, Mica Unire) in 1859 or 
                            the independence of the country and the annexation of Northern Dobruja in 1878, and also the 
                            occupation of Transylvania and Moldavia by the Prince of Wallachia, Michael the Brave, in 1600.</p>

                        <p>Today, the Great Union has an important meaning in Romania, and it is commemorated in the Great Union Day, 
                            the national day of the country, every 1 December. The centenary of the Great Union on 1 December 
                            2018 was widely celebrated in Romania, with military parades at cities like Alba Iulia or Bucharest 
                            to which many people (up to 550,000, 100,000 of them in Alba Iulia alone), including the President 
                            of Romania Klaus Iohannis, attended. The centenary was also celebrated in Moldova, where more than 
                            100 localities and 3 districts declared unification with Romania.</p>

                            <h2>The Romanian Revolution (1989)</h2>
                            <p>The Romanian revolution (Romanian: Revoluția română) was a period of violent civil unrest in 
                                Romania during December 1989 as a part of the revolutions of 1989 that occurred in several countries 
                                around the world, primarily within the Eastern Bloc. The Romanian revolution started in the 
                                city of Timișoara and soon spread throughout the country, ultimately culminating in the drumhead 
                                trial and execution of longtime Romanian Communist Party (PCR) General Secretary Nicolae Ceaușescu 
                                and his wife Elena, and the end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania. It was also the last 
                                removal of a Marxist–Leninist government in a Warsaw Pact country during the events of 1989, and the 
                                only one that violently overthrew a country's leadership and executed its leader; according to 
                                estimates, over one thousand people died and thousands more were injured.</p>

                            <p>Following World War II, Romania found itself inside the Soviet sphere of influence, with Communist 
                                rule officially declared in 1947. In April 1964, when Romania published a general policy paper 
                                worked out under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's instructions, the country was well on its way of carefully 
                                breaking away from Soviet control. Nicolae Ceaușescu became the country's leader the following year. 
                                Under his rule, Romania experienced a brief waning of internal repression that led to a positive image 
                                both at home and in the West. However, repression again intensified by the 1970s. Amid tensions in the 
                                late 1980s, early protests occurred in the city of Timișoara in mid-December on the part of the 
                                Hungarian minority in response to an attempt by the government to evict Hungarian Reformed Church 
                                pastor László Tőkés. In response, Romanians sought the deposition of Ceaușescu and a change in 
                                government in light of similar recent events in neighbouring nations. The country's ubiquitous 
                                secret police force, the Securitate, which was both one of the largest in the Eastern Bloc and 
                                for decades had been the main suppressor of popular dissent, frequently and violently quashing 
                                political disagreement, ultimately proved incapable of stopping the looming, and then highly fatal 
                                and successful revolt.</p>

                            <h2>Bran Castle</h2>
                            <p>Bran Castle is a castle in Bran, 25 kilometres (16 mi) southwest of Brașov. The castle was 
                                built by Saxons in 1377 who were given the privilege by Louis I of Hungary. It is a national 
                                monument and landmark in Transylvania. The fortress is on the Transylvanian side of the historical 
                                border with Wallachia, on road DN73.</p>

                            <p>Marketed outside Romania as Dracula's Castle, it is presented as the home of the title character 
                                in Bram Stoker's Dracula. There is no evidence that Stoker knew anything about this castle, which 
                                has only tangential associations with Vlad the Impaler, voivode of Wallachia, whose byname 'Drăculea' 
                                resembles that of Dracula. Stoker's description of Dracula's crumbling fictional castle also bears 
                                no resemblance to Bran Castle.</p>

                            <p>The castle is now a museum dedicated to displaying art and furniture collected by Queen Marie. 
                                Tourists can see the interior on their own or by a guided tour. At the bottom of the hill is 
                                a small open-air museum exhibiting traditional Romanian peasant structures (cottages, barns, 
                                water-driven machinery, etc.) from the Bran region.</p>

                            <p>The Palace of the Parliament , also known as the House of the Republic (Casa Republicii) 
                                or the People's House (Casa Poporului), is the seat of the Parliament of Romania, located atop 
                                Dealul Spirii in Bucharest, the national capital. The Palace reaches a height of 84 m (276 ft), 
                                has a floor area of 365,000 m2 (3,930,000 sq ft) and a volume of 2,550,000 m3 (90,000,000 cu ft). 
                                The Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building in the world, weighing about 4,098,500 tonnes 
                                (9.04 billion pounds), and is the third largest administrative building in the world.</p>

                            <p>The building was designed and supervised by chief architect Anca Petrescu, with a team of 
                                approximately 700 architects, and constructed over a period of 13 years (1984–1997) in modernist 
                                Neoclassical architectural forms and styles, with socialist realism in mind. The Palace was ordered 
                                by Nicolae Ceaușescu (1918–1989), the president of Communist Romania and the second of two long-ruling 
                                heads of state in the country since World War II, during a period in which the personality cult of 
                                political worship and adoration increased considerably for him and his family.</p>

                            <p>Known for its ornate interior composed of 23 sections, the palace houses the two chambers of the 
                                Parliament of Romania: the Senate (Senat) and the Chamber of Deputies (Camera Deputaților), along 
                                with three museums and an international conference center. The museums in the Palace are the National 
                                Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Communist Totalitarianism (established in 2015) and the 
                                Museum of the Palace. Though originally named the House of the Republic when under construction, 
                                the palace became widely known as the "People's House" after the Romanian Revolution of 
                                December 1989. Due to its impressive characteristics, events organized by state institutions and 
                                international bodies such as conferences and symposia take place there, but despite this about 70% 
                                of the building remains empty.</p>
