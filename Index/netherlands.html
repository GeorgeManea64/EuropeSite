                        <p>The Netherlands, informally Holland, is a country in Northwestern Europe, with overseas 
                            territories in the Caribbean. It is the largest of the four constituent countries of the 
                            Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders 
                            Germany to the east and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and 
                            west. It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Belgium. The official 
                            language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. 
                            Dutch, English, and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories. People from the Netherlands 
                            are referred to as Dutch.</p>

                        <p>Netherlands literally means "lower countries" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, 
                            with 26% below sea level Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of 
                            land reclamation that began in the 14th century. In the Republican period, which began in 1588, 
                            the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among 
                            the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. 
                            During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, 
                            established colonies and trading posts all over the world.</p>

                            <h2>Eighty Years War (1568–1648)</h2>
                            <p>The Eighty Years' War or Dutch Revolt was an armed conflict in the Habsburg Netherlands 
                                between disparate groups of rebels and the Spanish government. The causes of the war 
                                included the Reformation, centralisation, excessive taxation, and the rights and privileges 
                                of the Dutch nobility and cities. The Reconquista ended in 1492 with the fall of the Nasrid 
                                kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs.</p>

                            <p>After the initial stages, Philip II of Spain, the sovereign of the Netherlands, deployed his 
                                armies and regained control over most of the rebel-held territories. However, widespread mutinies 
                                in the Spanish army caused a general uprising. Under the leadership of the exiled William the 
                                Silent, the Catholic and Protestant-dominated provinces sought to establish religious peace 
                                while jointly opposing the king's regime with the Pacification of Ghent, but the general 
                                rebellion failed to sustain itself.</p>

                            <p>Facing a stalemate, the two sides agreed to a Twelve Years' Truce in 1609; when it expired in 1621, 
                                fighting resumed as part of the broader Thirty Years' War. An end was reached in 1648 with the 
                                Peace of Münster (a treaty that was part of the Peace of Westphalia), when Spain retained the 
                                Southern Netherlands and recognised the Dutch Republic as an independent country.</p>

                        <h2>The Dutch Golden Age (17th century)</h2>
                        <p>The Dutch Golden Age was a period in the history of the Netherlands which roughly lasted from 1588, 
                            when the Dutch Republic was established, to 1672, when the Rampjaar occurred. During this period, 
                            Dutch trade, scientific developments, art and overseas colonisation was among the most prominent 
                            in Europe. The first half of the period spanned from the beginning of the Eighty Years' War until 
                            its conclusion in 1648, with the second half lasting until the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War. 
                            During the period, Dutch colonialists, many of them affiliated with the East India Company and 
                            West India Company, established trading posts and colonies in the Americas, Southern Africa and 
                            Asia, protected by the powerful Dutch States Navy. The Dutch also dominated the triangular trade 
                            and Atlantic slave trade during this period.</p>

                        <p>Dutch culture flourished during this period as well. However, by the end of the 17th century, 
                            conflicts with neighbouring powers as well as declining economic influence led to the end of 
                            this period. The process by which the Dutch Republic became one of the foremost maritime and 
                            economic powers of the world during the era has been referred to as the "Dutch Miracle" by 
                            historian K. W. Swart. The term "Dutch Golden Age" has been controversial in the 21st century 
                            due to the extensive Dutch involvement in slavery and colonialism during the period, and it 
                            has been deprecated by several museums in the Netherlands, including the Amsterdam Museum.</p>

                            <h2>Netherlands in World War II (1940–1945)</h2>
                            <p>Despite Dutch neutrality, Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 as part of 
                                Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). On 15 May 1940, one day after the bombing of Rotterdam, 
                                the Dutch forces surrendered. The Dutch government and the royal family relocated to London. 
                                Princess Juliana and her children sought refuge in Ottawa, Canada, until after the war.</p>

                            <p>German occupation lasted in some areas until the German surrender in May 1945. 
                                Active resistance, at first carried out by a minority, grew in the course of the occupation. 
                                The occupiers deported the majority of the country's Jews to Nazi concentration camps.</p>  
                                
                            <p>Due to the high variation in the survival rate of Jewish inhabitants among local regions 
                                in the Netherlands, scholars have questioned the validity of a single explanation at the 
                                national level. In part due to the well-organised population registers, about 70% of the 
                                country's Jewish population were killed in the course of World War II—a much higher percentage 
                                than in either Belgium or France, although lower than in Lithuania. Declassified records 
                                revealed that the Germans paid a bounty to Dutch police and administration officials to 
                                locate and identify Jews, aiding in their capture. Communists in and around the city of 
                                Amsterdam organised the February strike—a general strike (February 1941) to protest against 
                                the persecution of Jewish citizens.</p>

                            <p>The Rijksmuseum is the national museum of the Netherlands dedicated to Dutch arts and history 
                                and is located in Amsterdam. The museum is located at the Museum Square in the borough of 
                                Amsterdam South, close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and the Concertgebouw.</p>

                            <p>The Rijksmuseum was founded in The Hague on 19 November 1798 and moved to Amsterdam in 1808, 
                                where it was first located in the Royal Palace and later in the Trippenhuis. The current 
                                main building was designed by Pierre Cuypers and first opened in 1885. On 13 April 2013, 
                                after a ten-year renovation which cost €375 million, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. 
                                In 2013 and 2014, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands with record numbers of 
                                2.2 million and 2.47 million visitors. It is also the largest art museum in the country.</p>

                                1 million objects from the years 1200–2000, among which are some masterpieces by Rembrandt, 
                                Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer. The museum also has a small Asian collection, which is on 
                                display in the Asian pavilion.</p>

                            <p>Zaanse Schans is a neighbourhood of Zaandam, near Zaandijk, Netherlands. 
                                It is best known for its collection of historic windmills and wooden houses that were 
                                relocated here from the wider region north of Amsterdam for preservation. From 1961 to 1974, 
                                old buildings from all over the region known as the Zaanstreek were relocated using lowboy 
                                trailers to Zaanse Schans. Two of the windmills in Zaanse Schans are preserved on their original 
                                site where they were first constructed, and therefore do not constitute part of the relocated 
                                structures. The Zaans Museum, established in 1994, near the first Zaanse Schans windmill, 
                                is located south of the neighbourhood. This architectural reserve for Zaanse timber construction 
                                is a protected village scene because of its architectural-historical and landscape value. 
                                It developed into an international tourist destination with several million visitors every year: 
                                in 2016, there were 1.8 million, in 2017 – 2.2 million.</p>
