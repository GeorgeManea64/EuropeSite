                        <p>Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe. 
                            It borders Ukraine to the north and east, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, 
                            Bulgaria to the south, Moldova to the east, and the Black Sea to the southeast. It has a mainly 
                            continental climate, and an area of 238,397 km2 (92,046 sq mi) with a population of 19 million people. 
                            Romania is the twelfth-largest country in Europe and the sixth-most populous member state of the 
                            European Union. Europe's second-longest river, the Danube, empties into the Danube Delta in the southeast 
                            of the country. The Carpathian Mountains cross Romania from the north to the southwest and include 
                            Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of 2,544 m (8,346 ft). Bucharest is the country's largest urban area 
                            and financial centre. Other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Constanța and Brașov.</p>

                        <p>Settlement in the territory of modern Romania began in the Lower Paleolithic, later becoming the 
                            Dacian Kingdom before Roman conquest and Romanisation. The modern Romanian state formed in 1859 with the 
                            unification of Moldavia and Wallachia under Alexandru Ioan Cuza, becoming Kingdom of Romania in 1881 
                            under Carol I. Romania gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877, formalised by the Treaty 
                            of Berlin. After World War I, Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina, and Bessarabia joined the Old Kingdom, 
                            forming Greater Romania, which reached its largest territorial extent. In 1940, under Axis pressure, 
                            Romania lost territories to Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union. Following the 1944 Romanian coup 
                            d'état, Romania switched sides to join the Allies. After World War II, it regained Northern Transylvania 
                            through the Paris Peace Treaties. Under Soviet occupation, King Michael I was forced to abdicate, and 
                            Romania became a socialist republic and Warsaw Pact member. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a 
                            transition to liberal democracy and a market economy.</p>

                            <h2>Defenestrations of Prague (1419, 1483, 1618)</h2>
                            <p>The Defenestrations of Prague were three incidents in the history of Bohemia in which people 
                                were defenestrated (thrown out of a window). Though already existing in Middle French, the word 
                                defenestrate is believed to have first been used in English in reference to the episodes in 
                                Prague in 1618 when the disgruntled Protestant estates threw two royal governors and their 
                                secretary out of a window of the Hradčany Castle and wrote an extensive apologia explaining 
                                their action. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, defenestration was not uncommon—the 
                                act carried elements of lynching and mob violence in the form of murder committed together.</p>

                            <p>The first governmental defenestration occurred in 1419, the second in 1483 and the third in 1618, 
                                although the term "Defenestration of Prague" more commonly refers to the third. Often, however, 
                                the 1483 event is not recognized as a "significant defenestration", which leads to some ambiguity 
                                when the 1618 defenestration is referred to as the "second Prague defenestration". The first and 
                                third defenestrations helped to trigger a prolonged religious conflict, either inside Bohemia 
                                (the Hussite Wars, 1st defenestration) or beyond (Thirty Years' War, 3rd defenestration), while 
                                the second helped establish a religious peace in the country for 31 years (Peace of Kutná Hora, 
                                2nd defenestration).</p>

                        <h2>The Foundation of Czechoslovakia (1918)</h2>
                        <p>The area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it collapsed at the end of World War I. 
                            The new state was founded by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, who served as its first president from 
                            14 November 1918 to 14 December 1935. He was succeeded by his close ally Edvard Beneš (1884–1948). </p>

                        <p>The roots of Czech nationalism go back to the 19th century, when philologists and educators, 
                            influenced by Romanticism, promoted the Czech language and pride in the Czech people. Nationalism 
                            became a mass movement in the second half of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the limited 
                            opportunities for participation in political life under Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as 
                            historian František Palacký (1798–1876) founded various patriotic self-help organizations which 
                            provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life before independence. 
                            Palacký supported Austro-Slavism and worked for a reorganized federal Austrian Empire, which would 
                            protect the Slavic speaking peoples of Central Europe against Russian and German threats.</p>

                            <h2>Velvet Revolution (1989)</h2>
                            <p>The Velvet Revolution or Gentle Revolution was a non-violent transition of power in what 
                                was then Czechoslovakia, occurring from 17 November to 28 November 1989. Popular demonstrations 
                                against the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia included students and 
                                older dissidents. The result was the end of 41 years of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and 
                                the subsequent dismantling of the command economy and conversion to a parliamentary republic.</p>

                            <p>On 17 November 1989 (International Students' Day), riot police suppressed a student demonstration 
                                in Prague. The event marked the 50th anniversary of a violently suppressed demonstration against 
                                the Nazi storming of Prague University in 1939 where 1,200 students were arrested and 9 killed 
                                (see Origin of International Students' Day). The 1989 event sparked a series of demonstrations 
                                from 17 November to late December and turned into an anti-communist demonstration. On 20 November, 
                                the number of protesters assembled in Prague grew from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated 
                                500,000. The entire top leadership of the Communist Party, including General Secretary Miloš Jakeš, 
                                resigned on 24 November. On 27 November, a two-hour general strike involving all citizens of 
                                Czechoslovakia was held.</p>

                            <p>Prague Castle is a castle complex in Prague, Czech Republic serving as the official residence 
                                and workplace of the president of the Czech Republic. Built in the 9th century, the castle has 
                                long served as the seat of power for kings of Bohemia, Holy Roman emperors, and presidents of 
                                Czechoslovakia. As such, the term "Prague Castle" or simply the "Castle" or "the Hrad" are often 
                                used as metonymy for the president and his staff and advisors. The Bohemian Crown Jewels are kept 
                                within a hidden room inside it.</p>

                            <p>According to the Guinness Book of Records, Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle in the world, 
                                occupying an area of almost 70,000 square metres (750,000 square feet), at about 570 metres 
                                (1,870 feet) in length and an average of about 130 metres (430 feet) wide. The castle is among 
                                the most visited tourist attractions in Prague, attracting over 1.8 million visitors annually.</p>

                            <h2>Charles Bridge</h2>
                            <p>Charles Bridge is a medieval stone arch bridge that crosses the Vltava river in Prague, 
                                Czech Republic. Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, 
                                and finished in the early 15th century. The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 
                                1158–1172 that had been severely damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally 
                                called Stone Bridge or Prague Bridge, but has been referred to as "Charles Bridge" since 1870.</p>

                            <p>As the only means of crossing the river Vltava until 1841, Charles Bridge was the most important 
                                connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This land connection 
                                made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe. The bridge is located 
                                on the historic coronation route of the Bohemian kings.</p>   
                                
                            <p>The bridge is 516 metres (1,693 ft) long and nearly 10 metres (33 ft) wide. Following the example 
                                of the Stone Bridge in Regensburg, it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards. 
                                It is protected by three bridge towers, two on the Lesser Quarter side (including the Malá Strana 
                                Bridge Tower) and one on the Old Town side, the Old Town Bridge Tower. The bridge is decorated by 
                                a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 
                                1700, but now all have been replaced by replicas.</p>
