                        <p>Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a country in Central Europe. 
                        It lies between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. 
                        Its sixteen constituent states have a total population of over 84 million in an area of 357,596 km2 
                        (138,069 sq mi), making it the most populous member state of the European Union. 
                        It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria 
                        and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. 
                        The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; 
                        the largest urban area is the Ruhr.</p>
                
                        <p>Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, 
                            with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts. 
                            Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. 
                            A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk 
                            of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the 
                            Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 
                            1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.</p>

                            <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, during the Peaceful Revolution, 
                                marked the beginning of the destruction of the Berlin Wall and the figurative Iron Curtain, 
                                as East Berlin transit restrictions were overwhelmed and discarded. Sections of the wall were 
                                breached, and planned deconstruction began the following June. It was one of the series of events 
                                that started the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. The fall of the inner German border 
                                took place shortly afterward. An end to the Cold War was declared at the Malta Summit in early 
                                December, and German reunification took place in October the following year.</p>

                        <h2>The Unification of Germany (January 18, 1871)</h2>
                        <p>The unification of Germany was a process of building the first nation-state for Germans with 
                            federal features based on the concept of Lesser Germany (one without Habsburgs' multi-ethnic 
                            Austria or its German-speaking part). It commenced on 18 August 1866 with the adoption of the 
                            North German Confederation Treaty establishing the North German Confederation, initially a 
                            military alliance de facto dominated by the Kingdom of Prussia which was subsequently deepened 
                            through adoption of the North German Constitution. Despite undergoing in later years several further 
                            changes of its name and borders, overhauls of its constitutional system, periods of limited sovereignty 
                            and interrupted unity of its territory or government, and despite dissolution of its dominant founding 
                            federated state, the polity resulting from the unification process continues today, surviving as the 
                            Federal Republic of Germany.</p>

                            <h2>Adolf Hilter and The Nazi Rise to Power (1933)</h2>
                            <p>The rise to power of Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, began 
                                in the newly established Weimar Republic in September 1919, when Hitler joined the German Workers' 
                                Party (DAP). He quickly rose to a place of prominence and became one of its most popular speakers. 
                                In an attempt to appeal more broadly to larger segments of the population and win over German workers, 
                                the party name was changed to the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and a new platform was adopted. Hitler was made 
                                the party leader in 1921 after he threatened to leave otherwise. By 1922, his control over the party 
                                was unchallenged. The Nazis were a right-wing party, but in the early years they also had 
                                anti-capitalist and anti-bourgeois elements. Hitler later initiated a purge of these elements 
                                and reaffirmed the Nazi Party's pro-business stance. This included the killing of Hitler's critics 
                                within the party during the Night of the Long Knives, which also served as a tool to secure power.</p>

                            <p>Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill of the foothills 
                                of the Alps in the very south of Germany, near the border with Austria. It is located in the

                                Hohenschwangau, which is also the location of Hohenschwangau Castle. The closest larger town is 
                                Füssen. The castle stands above the narrow gorge of the Pöllat stream, east of the Alpsee and 
                                Schwansee lakes, close to the mouth of the Lech into Forggensee.</p>

                            <p>The Brandenburg Gate is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin. One of the best-known 
                                landmarks of Germany, it was erected on the site of a former city gate that marked the start 
                                of the road from Berlin to Brandenburg an der Havel, the former capital of the Margraviate of 
                                Brandenburg. The current structure was built from 1788 to 1791 by orders of King Frederick William 
                                II of Prussia, based on designs by the royal architect Carl Gotthard Langhans. The bronze sculpture 
                                of the quadriga crowning the gate is a work by the sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow.</p>
