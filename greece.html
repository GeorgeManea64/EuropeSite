                        <p>Greece, officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country in Southeast Europe. 
                            Located on the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula, it shares land borders with Albania 
                            to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the east. 
                            The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete 
                            and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, 
                            spanning thousands of islands and nine traditional geographic regions. It has a population of over 
                            10 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras.</p>

                        <p>Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilisation and the birthplace of democracy, 
                            Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific 
                            and mathematical principles, theatre, and the Olympic Games. The Ancient Greeks were organised 
                            into various independent city-states, or poleis (singular polis), that spanned the Mediterranean 
                            and Black seas. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, 
                            with his son Alexander the Great conquering much of the known ancient world from the Near East to 
                            northwestern India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence 
                            in antiquity.</p>

                            <h2>Battle of Marathon (490 BC)</h2>
                            <p>The Battle of Marathon took place in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. 
                                It was fought between the citizens of Athens, aided by Plataea, and a Persian force commanded 
                                by Datis and Artaphernes. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia under 
                                King Darius I to subjugate Greece. The Greek army inflicted a crushing defeat on the more 
                                numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars.</p>

                            <p>The first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the Ionian Revolt, 
                                when the city-states of Athens and Eretria each sent a force to support the cities of 
                                Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded 
                                in capturing and burning Sardis, but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. 
                                In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down the two cities that had aided the failed revolt. 
                                According to Herodotus, Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow 
                                "upwards towards heaven", saying as he did so: 
                                "Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!" 
                                Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say 
                                "Master, remember the Athenians" three times before dinner each day.</p>

                        <h2>Athenian Democracy (6th century BC)</h2>
                        <p>Athenian democracy developed around the 6th century BC in the Greek city-state (known as a polis) 
                            of Athens, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica, and focusing on 
                            supporting liberty, equality, and security. Although Athens is the most familiar of the democratic 
                            city-states in ancient Greece, it was not the only one, nor was it the first; multiple other 
                            city-states adopted similar democratic constitutions before Athens. By the late 4th century BC, 
                            as many as half of the over one thousand existing Greek cities might have been democracies. 
                            Athens practiced a political system of legislation and executive bills. Participation was open to adult, 
                            free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted 
                            no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.</p>

                        <p>Solon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508–07 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the 
                            development of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by 
                            organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth. 
                            The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was 
                            twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the 
                            Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; 
                            the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than 
                            the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. 
                            The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of 
                            democracy is debated.</p>

                            <h2>Fall of Constantinople (1453)</h2>
                            <p>The Fall of Constantinople, also known as the Conquest of Constantinople, 
                                was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. 
                                The city was captured on 29 May 1453 as part of the culmination of a 55-day siege 
                                which had begun on 6 April.</p>

                            <p>The attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, 
                                was commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed "the Conqueror"), 
                                while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. After conquering the city, 
                                Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople.</p>  
                                
                            <p>The fall of Constantinople and of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, 
                                marking the effective end of the Roman Empire, a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had 
                                lasted nearly 1,500 years. For many modern historians, the fall of Constantinople marks the 
                                end of the medieval period and the beginning of the early modern period. The city's fall also 
                                stood as a turning point in military history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended 
                                upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. The walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian 
                                walls, protected Constantinople from attack for 800 years and were noted as some of the most 
                                advanced defensive systems in the world at the time. However, these fortifications were overcome 
                                with the use of gunpowder, specifically from Ottoman cannons and bombards, heralding a change in 
                                siege warfare. The Ottoman cannons repeatedly fired massive cannonballs weighing 500 kilograms 
                                (1,100 lb) over 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) which created gaps in the Theodosian walls for the Ottoman siege.p>

                            <h2>Acropolis of Athens</h2>
                            <p>The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens, 
                                Greece, and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical 
                                significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. The word Acropolis is from Greek ἄκρον (akron) 
                                'highest point, extremity' and πόλις (polis) 'city'. The term acropolis is generic and there are 
                                many other acropoleis in Greece. During ancient times the Acropolis of Athens was also more 
                                properly known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man Cecrops, the supposed first Athenian king.</p>

                            <p>While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as early as the 4th millennium BC, 
                                it was Pericles (c. 495–429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction 
                                of the buildings whose present remains are the site's most important ones, including the Parthenon, 
                                the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike. The Parthenon and the other buildings 
                                were seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the Venetians during the Morean War when gunpowder 
                                being stored by the then Turkish rulers in the Parthenon was hit by a Venetian bombardment and exploded.</p>

                            <p>Santorini, officially Thira is a Greek island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km 
                                (120 mi) southeast from the mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago 
                                formed by the Santorini caldera. It is the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, 
                                with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2021 census population of 15,480. 
                                The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, 
                                and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi, Anydros, and Christiana. 
                                The total land area is 91 km2 (35 sq mi). Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit.</p>

                            <p>It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. 
                                The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km (300 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi) wide. 
                                The region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years ago, though volcanism on 
                                Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri. 
                                One of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history struck the island about 3,600 years ago, 
                                leaving a large water-filled caldera surrounded by deep volcanic ash deposits.</p>

                            <p>De in legend previously called Pytho , was an ancient sacred precinct and the seat of Pythia, 
                                the major oracle who was consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient classical world. 
                                The ancient Greeks considered the centre of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone 
                                monument known as the Omphalos of Delphi (navel).</p>

                            <p>According to the Suda, Delphi took its name from the Delphyne, the she-serpent (drakaina) 
                                who lived there and was killed by the god Apollo (in other accounts the serpent was the male 
                                serpent (drakon) Python). The sacred precinct occupies a delineated region on the south-western 
                                slope of Mount Parnassus.</p>

                            <p>It is now an extensive archaeological site, and since 1938 a part of Parnassos National Park. 
                                The precinct is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in having had a great influence 
                                in the ancient world, as evidenced by the various monuments built there by most of the important
