                        <p>Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe. 
                            It extends from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains in the south, 
                            bordered by Lithuania and Russia to the northeast, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and 
                            the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west. The territory has a varied landscape, 
                            diverse ecosystems, and a temperate climate. Poland is composed of sixteen voivodeships and is 
                            the fifth most populous member state of the European Union (EU), with over 38 million people, 
                            and the fifth largest EU country by land area, covering 312,696 km2 (120,733 sq mi). 
                            The capital and largest city is Warsaw; other major cities include Kraków, Wrocław, 
                            Łódź, Poznań, and Gdańsk.</p>

                        <p>Prehistoric human activity on Polish soil dates to the Lower Paleolithic, with continuous 
                            settlement since the end of the Last Glacial Period. Culturally diverse throughout late antiquity, 
                            in the early medieval period the region became inhabited by the West Slavic tribal Polans, who gave 
                            Poland its name. The process of establishing statehood coincided with the conversion of a pagan 
                            ruler of the Polans to Christianity in 966 under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1025, 
                            the Kingdom of Poland emerged, and in 1569 it cemented its long-standing association with Lithuania, 
                            forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. At the time, the Commonwealth was one of Europe's great 
                            powers, with an elective monarchy and a uniquely liberal political system. It adopted Europe's first 
                            modern constitution in 1791.</p>

                            <h2>Christianization of Poland (966)</h2>
                            <p>The Christianization of Poland refers to the introduction and subsequent spread of Christianity in 
                                Poland.The impetus to the process was the Baptism of Poland, the personal baptism of Mieszko I, 
                                the first ruler of the future Polish state, and much of his court. The ceremony took place on 
                                Holy Saturday, 14 April 966 (under the Julian pre-Gregorian calendar, equivalent to 19 April 966 
                                Gregorian), although the exact location is disputed by historians, with the cities of Poznań and 
                                Gniezno being the most likely sites. Mieszko's wife, Dobrawa of Bohemia, is often seen as a major 
                                influence on Mieszko's decision to accept Christianity.</p>

                            <p>While the spread of Christianity in Poland took centuries to finish, the process was ultimately 
                                successful, as within several decades Poland joined the rank of established European states recognised 
                                by the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. According to historians, the baptism of Poland marks 
                                the beginning of Polish statehood. Nevertheless, the Christianization was a long and arduous process, 
                                as most of the Polish population remained pagan until the pagan reaction during the 1030s.</p>

                        <h2>Union of Lublin (1569)</h2>
                        <p>The Union of Lublin was signed on 1 July 1569 in Lublin, Poland, and created a single state, 
                            the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest countries in Europe at the time. 
                            It replaced the personal union of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of 
                            Lithuania with a real union and an elective monarchy, as Sigismund II Augustus, the last 
                            of the Jagiellons, remained childless after three marriages. In addition, the autonomy of 
                            Royal Prussia was largely abandoned. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union 
                            since the Union of Grodno (1566), became a Polish–Lithuanian condominium.</p>

                        <p>The Commonwealth was ruled by a single elected monarch who carried out the duties of King of Poland 
                            and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and governed with a common Senate and parliament (the Sejm). 
                            The Union is seen by some as an evolutionary stage in the Polish–Lithuanian alliance and personal 
                            union, necessitated also by Lithuania's dangerous position in wars with Russia.</p>

                            <h2>Communism in Poland (1882 - 1989)</h2>
                            <p>Communism in Poland can trace its origins to the late 19th century: the Marxist First 
                                Proletariat party was founded in 1882. Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919) of the Social Democracy 
                                of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania party and the publicist Stanisław Brzozowski (1878–1911) 
                                were important early Polish Marxists.</p>

                            <p>During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic, some socialists formed the Communist Party 
                                of Poland. Most of the KPP's leaders and activists perished in the Soviet Union during Joseph Stalin's 
                                Great Purge in the 1930s, and the party was abolished by the Communist International (Comintern) in 1938. </p>

                            <h2>Wawel Royal Castle</h2>
                            <p>The Wawel Royal Castle and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically 
                                and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, 
                                it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great[2] and enlarged over the centuries 
                                into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European 
                                architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods.</p>

                            <p>The castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the 
                                left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex 
                                consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel 
                                Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings 
                                can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and 
                                Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded 
                                over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage 
                                Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.</p>

                            <p>For centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, 
                                Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum 
                                encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an 
                                important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them 
                                the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, 
                                Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the 
                                largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, 
                                the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art. With over 
                                3.1 million visitors in 2024, Wawel Castle is the most visited art museum in Poland and the 
                                17th most visited art museum in the world.</p>

                            <p>The site includes the main concentration camp at Auschwitz I and the remains of the concentration 
                                and extermination camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Both were developed and run by Nazi Germany 
                                during its occupation of Poland in 1939–1945. The Polish government has preserved the site as 
                                a research centre and in memory of the 1.1 million people who died there, including 960,000 Jews, 
                                during World War II and the Holocaust. It became a World Heritage Site in 1979. Piotr Cywiński 
                                is the museum's director.</p>

                            <p>Warsaw Old Town, also known as Old Town, and historically known as Old Warsaw, 
                                is a neighbourhood, and an area of the City Information System, in the city of Warsaw, 
                                Poland, located within the district of Śródmieście. It is the oldest portion of the city, 
                                and contains numerous historic buildings, mostly from 17th and 18th centuries, such as the 
                                Royal Castle, city walls, St. John's Cathedral, and the Barbican, the Old Town Market Square 
                                and the Warsaw Mermaid Statue. The settlement itself dates back to between the 13th and 
                                14th centuries, and was granted town privileges c. 1300.</p>

                            <p>During World War II, the Old Town was nearly totally destroyed, and subsequently reconstructed. 
                                The project was the world's first attempt to resurrect an entire historic city core and was 
                                included on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1980. The reconstruction efforts were again 
                                recognized in 2011 when all its documents and records were added by UNESCO to its Memory of 
                                the World international register.</p>
